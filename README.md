This project is about the card game 'SET', and on how to implement it in python. The goal was to be able to play the game against a computer, in a visual environment created with pygame. 
The project consists of 5 steps:
1. Write a class for SET cards that supports at least property comparison. You can also implement a visualization method.  
2. Write an algorithm that checks if a given set of 3 cards is a SET.
3. Write an algorithm to find all possible sets from a given collection of 12 cards.
4. Also, write an algorithm that finds one set.
5. Build a game around these algorithms. Your program should display 12 cards on the screen (numbered) and ask the user to input a SET (e.g., ‘1, 5, 10‘  if cards 1, 5, and 10 form a set). If the user has not found a SET after a given time, and the computer has, the computer gets a point. You can adjust the difficulty of the game by making this time shorter or longer. If no set is found at all after a predetermined time, remove the top 3 cards and replenish with 3 new cards. You can use the Python module pygame.

We have worked on these steps in seperate files, which can be found in the corresponding folders. 

Our final game is called 'SET_the_game.py'. 

Our reccomended way to start the game is by using GitHub desktop, and VScode.
Once the repository SET is visible in VScode, one can start the code of the file 'SET_the_game.py', and the game will start automatically. 
The rules of the game can be found in the report, or on internet.
